## FSJS Techdegree Project 4 (teamtreehouse.com)

### Author: Anton Kilk

### Description:

React Gallery App uses Axios for fetching data from the Flickr API to display 24 images. Use "Search" or choose one of the three subjects in navigation panel. 

With the help of powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is built in the style of modern single page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.
